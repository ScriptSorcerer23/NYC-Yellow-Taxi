## üîç Project Overview

This project uses the **NYC Yellow Taxi dataset** to perform:

- **Data Preprocessing** (PySpark using AWS EMR)
- **Model Training**:
  - Linear Regression (Fare Prediction)
  - Logistic Regression & Decision Tree (Payment Type)
  - KMeans Clustering
- **MLflow Logging** for experiment tracking
- **Deployment Stack**:
  - Frontend: Streamlit (Dockerized)
  - Backend: FastAPI 
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Hosting: AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu)
